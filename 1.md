### **Catalan Numbers and BSTs**

**Number of distinct BSTs with *n* distinct keys = n-th Catalan number.**

$$
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}
$$

### **Why do they match?**

For any BST:

* Choose one key as the root.
* All keys smaller go to the left subtree.
* All keys larger go to the right subtree.

If the root’s left subtree has **i** keys, then the right subtree has **n − i − 1** keys.

The number of BSTs with that root is:

$$
C_i \cdot C_{n-i-1}
$$

Summing over all possible choices of i gives:

$$
C_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} C_i \cdot C_{n-i-1}
$$

This recurrence is **exactly** the Catalan recurrence, so the number of BSTs is the Catalan number.
